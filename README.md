# TFDet
This is an official repository of our TFDet, which is submitted to ICCV 2023.
TFDet is an abbreviation for "Target-aware Fusion for RGB-T Pedestrian Detection."
Our TFDet aims to highlight the feature representation of pedestrians while suppressing the background areas. 
Experiments show that our TFDet achieves state-of-the-art performance on two challenging multi-spectral pedestrian detection benchmarks: KAIST and LLVIP. 
Notably, TFDet performs especially well under challenging low-light conditions.
