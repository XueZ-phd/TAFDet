# TFDet: Target-aware Fusion for RGB-T Pedestrian Detection
* This is an official repository of our TFDet.
* TFDet is an abbreviation for "Target-aware Fusion for RGB-T Pedestrian Detection."
* Our TFDet aims to highlight the feature representation of pedestrians while suppressing it in the background areas. 
* Experiments show that our TFDet achieves state-of-the-art performance on two challenging multi-spectral pedestrian detection benchmarks: KAIST and LLVIP. 
* Notably, TFDet performs especially well under challenging low-light conditions.
